# 180110 EvG: created

/1 UPON FIRST USE
- remove all lines from blacklist starting with IP address
- edit configuration file to meet requirements
  -- very important to set correct value for LOCAL IPs!
- edit dbl.d/*.sh scripts if necessary

/2 dbl.d/*.sh SCRIPTS
All bash scripts ending at ".sh" in this directory will be sourced by blacklist_ applications.
Each script must produce simple list of IP addresses to be blocked (one per line)
$LIMIT variable determines after how many occurences IP address will be blocked

/3 blacklist_* SCRIPTS
located in /usr/local/bin:

- blacklist_update:
  -- called from /etc/cron.d/blacklist (every 15min)
  -- scans log files for suspicious IP addresses and adds them to blacklist
  -- calls blacklist_cleanup & blacklist_load

- blacklist_cleanup
  -- removes old entries from blacklist
 
- blacklist_load
  -- instructs ufw to add blocking IP addresses from blacklist
     (lines removed from blacklist will not be removed from ufw; restart firewall for this)

/4 NOTES
- add blacklist_load to rc.local
- add blacklist_load to script that resets ufw firewall
